### Project 1 - Predicting Donors' Income using supervised learning

**Description:** 

In this project, I employed several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I then chose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. My goal with this implementation was to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.
